## 👩‍🔬 About Me

Biologist graduated from the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar) and currently a Master's student, with experience in bioinformatics, transcriptomics, genomics, and biostatistics.

My academic background includes RNA-seq analysis in mouse models for diabetes research, transcriptomic studies in bovine embryos to evaluate the impact of cytokines on early development, and variant calling analysis of the bovine genome. I also have strong experience in statistical analysis applied to scientific research, including authorship support for peer-reviewed publications.
