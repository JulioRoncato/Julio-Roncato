## 🧬 RNA-seq Analysis in Mouse Models for Diabetes Research

This project presents a complete RNA-seq analysis workflow applied to mouse samples in the context of diabetes-related gene expression studies. The analysis was originally developed during my undergraduate research project.

### 🔹 Experimental Overview
RNA sequencing data were generated from mouse samples to investigate transcriptional changes associated with diabetes, with a particular focus on genes involved in metabolic regulation.

### 🔹 Bioinformatics Workflow

#### 1. Pre-processing and Alignment (Linux environment)
All initial bioinformatics steps were performed in a Linux environment:

- Quality control of raw FASTQ files
- Read alignment against the mouse reference genome
- Generation of sorted BAM files
- Gene-level read quantification using `featureCounts`

#### 2. Statistical Analysis and Visualization (R environment)
Downstream analyses were conducted in R, including:

- Import of raw count matrices
- Data normalization
- Exploratory data analysis (PCA and clustering)
- Differential gene expression analysis
- Visualization of significant transcriptional changes

### 🔹 Data Availability
Due to data confidentiality, the datasets used in this repository are simulated or derived from publicly available RNA-seq data to reproduce the original analytical workflow. All scripts and analytical steps remain identical to those applied in the original study.

### 🔹 Key Outcomes
- Identification of differentially expressed genes associated with diabetic conditions
- Visualization of transcriptional patterns across experimental groups
- Reproducible and well-documented RNA-seq analysis pipeline
