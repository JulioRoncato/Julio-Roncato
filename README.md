## 👩‍🔬 About Me

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences from the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar), with a strong background in Molecular Biology and Reproductive Biology. I am currently a Master’s student in **Animal Reproduction (Bovine)**, focusing on the integration of experimental biology and bioinformatics to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying reproductive and metabolic phenotypes.

My academic training combines **wet-lab molecular techniques**, **statistical analysis**, and **bioinformatics workflows**, allowing me to approach biological questions from both experimental and computational perspectives.
